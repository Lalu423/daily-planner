# Daily-Planner

## Description 
This is a daily work-day planner. The elements on this page were created using Jquery. The user will notice the current day is posted under the header of the website. This app will provide a text field for the user to enter their to-do list within the given hours. The user will also notice that all past hours will be represented by a grey box, the current time will be represented by a red box and the future hours will be represented with a green box. The app does this by updating the time and changing the class of the text boxes based on the hour of the day.  

The user will also be able to click the blue button to the right of the text area to save their to-do list, they will be able to access this information even after closing the page thanks to local storage.
